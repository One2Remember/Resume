## Hello!
My name is Emmanuel, and I am currently a Masters of Science student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on parallel programming for multi-agent task and motion planning.
  
My expected graduation date is in May of 2023, and I am looking for full-time opportunities in the San Francisco Bay Area (or remote).
