## Hello!
### I'm a CS Senior at CSU East Bay, with a special interest in the intersection of machine learning and climatology, and am currently working for T'ena Health Technologies as a full stack software engineer. I'm building an app for them to launch in Ethiopia in December, 2020, to bring physical rehabilition services to those unable to frequently visit  their healthcare specialists. 
### I'm also working on an app to identify areas at high risk of spreading Covid-19 (and other dangerous contagions), with a team of graduate students down at CSU East Bay.
### I am looking for any and all opportunities to expand my knowledge in software engineering, machine learning, and climate science, as I'd like to build my career in these disciplines.
